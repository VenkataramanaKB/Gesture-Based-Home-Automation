# Gesture-Based-Home-Automation

Current smart homes rely primarily on voice-based control and sensor modules. 
Traditionally, smart homes have relied solely on smart plugs. However, our proposed device is compatible with devices whether or not they have smart plugs.

My solution addresses this challenge using state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms. 

This system boasts high precision and accuracy, resulting in efficient power savings. 
Controlling devices is made even simpler with gesture-based controls.
